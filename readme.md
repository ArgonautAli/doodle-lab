# Doodle Lab 🎨✨

**Doodle Lab** is an interactive web tool that leverages a Neural Network model to classify hand-drawn doodles in real-time. This project demonstrates the power of machine learning and web technologies like TensorFlow.js and JavaScript, providing users with a fun and engaging way to explore AI.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-Time Doodle Classification**: Users can draw on a canvas, and the AI model predicts what the doodle represents instantly.
- **Built with Keras**: The underlying model is developed using Keras, a powerful and easy-to-use deep learning library.
- **Deployed with AWS**: The model is deployed on AWS, making it accessible globally with minimal latency.
- **Integrated with TensorFlow.js**: The model runs directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js, providing a seamless user experience without the need for server-side processing.
